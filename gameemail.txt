LAB RECORD
Experiment: Jenkins – CI using GitHub Webhooks & Email Notification
AIM

To configure:

Continuous Integration (CI) in Jenkins using GitHub Webhooks

Email Notifications for Jenkins build success or failure

SOFTWARE / TOOLS USED

Jenkins

GitHub

ngrok

Gmail (App Password)

PART–A: CI USING GITHUB WEBHOOK + NGROK
THEORY
Continuous Integration (CI)

CI is a process where developers push code frequently to GitHub, and Jenkins automatically builds and tests the project.

Webhook

A webhook is a URL where GitHub sends a message whenever an event happens (e.g., push).
This message triggers Jenkins automatically.

Need for ngrok

If Jenkins runs on localhost, GitHub cannot reach it.
ngrok creates a public URL and forwards GitHub requests to local Jenkins.

PROCEDURE
Step 1: Start Jenkins & ngrok

Start Jenkins locally
Example URL: http://localhost:8085/

Download ngrok and run:

ngrok http 8085


Copy the ngrok HTTPS URL
Example:
https://1234abcd.ngrok.io

Step 2: Configure GitHub Webhook

Go to GitHub Repository → Settings → Webhooks → Add Webhook

Payload URL:

https://1234abcd.ngrok.io/github-webhook/


Content type:
application/json

Event selection:
Select → Just the push event

Click Add webhook

Step 3: Configure Jenkins to Accept Webhooks

Go to Jenkins Dashboard → Your Job → Configure

Scroll to Build Triggers

Enable:
✔ GitHub hook trigger for GITScm polling

Click Save

Step 4: Test CI

Make any change in your project

Push to GitHub:

git add .
git commit -m "testing webhook"
git push


GitHub sends webhook

Jenkins automatically starts the build

OUTCOME (Part–A)

GitHub successfully connected to Jenkins via webhook

Every push automatically triggers Jenkins build

CI is functioning correctly

PART–B: EMAIL NOTIFICATION SETUP
THEORY

Jenkins sends email alerts to developers after build success/failure.
Gmail requires a 16-digit App Password (because normal password won’t work with Jenkins).

PROCEDURE
Step 1: Create Gmail App Password

Open: https://myaccount.google.com

Go to Security → 2-Step Verification → Turn ON

Then go to Security → App Passwords

Choose:

App → Other (Custom Name): Jenkins-Demo

Generate → copy the 16-digit password

Step 2: Install Email Extension Plugin

Jenkins Dashboard → Manage Jenkins → Manage Plugins

Search and install:
Email Extension Plugin

Step 3: Configure Global Email Settings

Go to: Manage Jenkins → Configure System

A. E-mail Notification
Field	Value
SMTP Server	smtp.gmail.com
Use SMTP Auth	✔ Enabled
User Name	your Gmail ID
Password	16-digit App Password
Use SSL	✔ Enabled
SMTP Port	465
Reply-To Address	your Gmail ID

Click: Test configuration by sending test e-mail

B. Extended Email Notification
Field	Value
SMTP Server	smtp.gmail.com
SMTP Port	465
Use SSL	✔
Credentials	Add Gmail + App Password
Default Content Type	text/html

Click Save

Step 4: Configure Email for a Specific Job

Open Job → Configure

Scroll to Post-build Actions

Click: Add post-build action → Editable Email Notification

Fill:

Project Recipient List: your mail IDs

Triggers: Failure / Success / Both

Content type: default

Click Save

Step 5: Test Email

Run the job or push code

If the build fails/succeeds → you will receive an email from Jenkins
